# How to Build and Run the Application

## Important Note: Prepare a Separate Testing Folder
Before starting the conversion and build process, **make a copy** of your original project folder or files. Use this copied folder for testing to ensure your original files remain intact. This will help:
- Avoid accidental modifications or data loss in the original project.
- Keep a working backup in case issues arise during testing.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python 3.12 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - During installation, check the option to **add Python to your system PATH**.
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Install pip (if not already installed)**:
   - Check if pip is installed:
     ```bash
     python -m pip --version
     ```
   - If pip is missing, install it:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```

3. **Install Required Tools**:
   - Install `cython` and `pyinstaller`:
     ```bash
     pip install cython pyinstaller
     ```
   - Verify the installations:
     ```bash
     cython --version
     pyinstaller --version
     ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Save the following dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file:
     ```plaintext
     PyYAML>=6.0
     netmiko>=4.5.0
     rich>=13.5.2
     ```
   - Install them:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Step 2: Convert `main.py` to Cython

1. **Copy Your Files to the Testing Folder**:
   - Ensure the original `main.py` file and any dependencies are safely backed up.
   - Work in a **separate copy** of your project folder to avoid accidental data loss.

2. **Rename Your Python File**:
   - Rename `main.py` to `main.pyx` to indicate it will use Cython.

3. **Create a Setup File**:
   - Create a `setup.py` file in the same directory with the following content:
     ```python
     from setuptools import setup
     from Cython.Build import cythonize

     setup(
         ext_modules=cythonize("main.pyx"),
     )
     ```

4. **Compile the Cython File**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python setup.py build_ext --inplace
     ```
   - This will generate a compiled file (`main.so` or `main.pyd`, depending on your system).

5. **Test the Compiled File**:
   - Create a new script, `run.py`, to use the compiled file:
     ```python
     import main
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main.main()
     ```
   - Run `run.py` to ensure everything works:
     ```bash
     python run.py
     ```

---

## Step 3: Build the Executable

1. Open a terminal in the testing folder.
2. Run the following command to create a standalone `.exe`:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --strip --name=CommandMate --collect-all=netmiko --collect-all=rich --collect-all=concurrent run.py
   ```

---

## Step 4: Locate the Executable

- After the build completes, navigate to the `dist` folder.
- The executable file (`CommandMate.exe`) will be located there.

---

## Step 5: Create a Launcher (Optional)

To keep the terminal window open after execution:
1. Create a file named `CommandMate_launcher.bat` in the same directory as `CommandMate.exe`.
2. Add the following content:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   cls
   title CommandMate.exe Launcher
   echo Launching CommandMate.exe...
   echo =====================
   CommandMate.exe
   echo =====================
   echo.
   echo Program finished. Choose an option:
   echo [1] Relaunch the program
   echo [2] Close this window
   echo.
   set /p choice=Enter your choice (1-2): 

   if "%choice%"=="1" (
       cls
       echo Relaunching CommandMate.exe...
       echo =====================
       CommandMate.exe
       pause
       exit
   ) else if "%choice%"=="2" (
       echo Closing...
       exit
   ) else (
       echo Invalid choice. Closing...
       pause
   )
   ```

---

## Step 6: Run the Application

- Double-click `CommandMate_launcher.bat` to start the program with a persistent terminal window.
- Alternatively, double-click `CommandMate.exe` for a temporary terminal window.

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python packages are installed before building:
```plaintext
PyYAML>=6.0
netmiko>=4.5.0
rich>=13.5.2
```

---

## Information

This script is **parallel** because it uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module to execute tasks concurrently. The line:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
```

limits the number of parallel threads to a maximum of **10 workers**. This means:
- Up to 10 hosts will have commands executed simultaneously.
- Additional hosts (if more than 10) will wait in a queue until a thread becomes available.

By increasing `max_workers`, you can allow more threads to run concurrently. However, keep in mind system resource constraints and potential limitations of the network devices being managed.
